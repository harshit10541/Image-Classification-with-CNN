Image Classifier using CNN
Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for image classification from scratch using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras.
	• Tools & technologies used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, GitHub.
	• Developed a custom CNN model to classify images into predefined categories.
	• Implemented image preprocessing techniques, such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation, to improve model accuracy.
	• Trained the model with multiple layers (convolution, pooling, fully connected) and applied techniques such as dropout and batch normalization to prevent overfitting.
	• Achieved high classification accuracy through hyperparameter tuning and performance optimization.
	• Created detailed documentation and visualized model performance using Matplotlib and TensorBoard.
	• Future updates: Plan to deploy the model using a web interface, enabling real-time image classification by users.
